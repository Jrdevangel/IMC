# IMC Java exercise

This is the IMC Java exercise where the user enters two parameters per keyboard: height and measure.

From line 5 to line 10, I set the variables to be able to use it later.

Then on line 11 I execute the statement "scanner.close()" because it means that I won't put more variable.
In line 12 I put the necessary formula to calculate the IMC, and in line 13 I put the mathematical formula
to make the body mass index and in line 14 I print a message per screen that informs the user what weight
he is in.

And finally, from line 16 to line 31 I explain how I did to extract each weight category.
